# AXI-SUBSYSTEM-INTEGRATION-DESIGN-AND-VERIFICATION
This repository showcases the design and verification of an AXI4-based subsystem, including interconnects, asynchronous buffers, buffer controller and ECC-enabled memory controller. The project was verified through behavioral and post-synthesis simulation using Vivado 2019.2.

## Features
- ECC logic for fault-tolerant AXI burst transactions
- AXI-to-AXI Lite bridging and multi-slave interface controller

## Tools Used
- Verilog/SystemVerilog
- Vivado 2019.2
- Synopsys Design Compiler
